\toprule
Limitation & Current Impact & Required Upgrade \\
\midrule
No matched dense baseline under equal budget
& Throughput claims are benchmark-local, not fair end-to-end superiority
& Add dense baseline with same parameter/FLOP envelope \\

No external task-level benchmark table
& No public quality leaderboard claim is supported
& Add fixed evaluation harness and report external metrics \\

Robustness seeds only shuffle test order
& Limited signal on model/data stochastic stability
& Add randomness controls for model init/data order \\

n=5 CI with normal approximation
& Variance estimates may be optimistic on noisy hardware
& Increase sample count and/or use small-sample robust reporting \\

Hardware-state controls not pinned
& Bench variance can drift with thermal and scheduler noise
& Add governor/thermal pinning and multi-time-window repeats \\
