\section{Limitations and Threats to Validity}
\input{tables/limitations}

The current evidence is strongest on mechanism and systems behavior, and weaker
on broad external generalization. Specifically:
\begin{enumerate}
\item External evaluation is currently a small harness snapshot
(\texttt{mmlu-tiny}) rather than full public benchmark suites.
\item Throughput claims are micro-benchmark scoped; end-to-end serving
latency/throughput under production traffic is not yet reported.
\item Training-cost claims (e.g., wall-clock convergence, energy efficiency
versus alternatives) are not yet established in this package.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Next upgrades for a stronger publication.}
(1) Expand external evaluation to larger public datasets and stronger baselines.
(2) Add serving-level results (batching, queueing, p50/p95/p99 latency).
(3) Add training-side ablations for routing temperature, bottleneck size, and
quantization granularity under fixed compute budgets.
