\section{Limitations and Threats to Validity}
\input{tables/limitations}

This package is intentionally conservative in claims. The current evidence is
internal and benchmark-scoped. It does not yet establish superiority on public
leaderboards or broad external generalization.

\paragraph{Immediate next rigor upgrades.}
(1) Move from tiny synthetic external harness to public benchmark datasets.
(2) Extend robustness beyond test-order shuffling to model/data randomness.
(3) Increase PS sample count and tighten hardware-state controls.
(4) Ensure golden artifacts are independently produced and frozen.
