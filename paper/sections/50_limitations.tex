\section{Limitations and Threats to Validity}
\input{tables/limitations}

This package is intentionally conservative in claims. The current evidence is
internal and benchmark-scoped. It does not yet establish superiority on public
leaderboards or broad external generalization.

\paragraph{Immediate next rigor upgrades.}
(1) Add a matched dense baseline under equal parameter and compute budgets.
(2) Add external task-level evaluation harnesses.
(3) Extend robustness beyond test-order shuffling to model/data randomness.
(4) Increase PS sample count and tighten hardware-state controls.
