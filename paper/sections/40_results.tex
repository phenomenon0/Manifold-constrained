\section{Results}
\subsection{Gate Status}
From \texttt{artifacts/reports/summary.md} (timestamp 2026-02-07T01:36:56Z):
Q=PASS, QS=PASS (5 seeds), P=PASS, PS=PASS (5 runs), T=PASS.

\subsection{Performance (Canonical Multi-Run Statistics)}
\input{tables/perf_multirun}

Relative to serial in the same benchmark family, mean throughput improves by
5.12x for \texttt{Parallel} and 5.17x for \texttt{ParallelZeroCopy}.

\subsection{Parity and Correctness}
\input{tables/track_t_parity}

Track T confirms numerical agreement against the tested golden artifacts,
including deterministic replay over 10 runs.
