\section{Results}
\subsection{Overall Gate Status}
From \texttt{artifacts/reports/summary.md} (timestamp 2026-02-08T11:37:19Z):
Q=PASS, QS=PASS (5 seeds), P=PASS, PS=PASS (5 runs), DB=PASS, T=PASS, X=PASS.

\subsection{Sparse Execution Speedup Is Stable}
\input{tables/perf_multirun}
Across five runs, \texttt{Parallel} achieves 529.7 tok/s versus 100.6 tok/s
for serial (5.26x), and \texttt{ParallelZeroCopy} achieves 512.8 tok/s
(5.10x). This indicates the sparse grouped-dispatch path preserves a large
speed advantage under repeated measurement, not only single-run peaks.

\subsection{QSMoE Beats Matched Dense Baseline in Tested Regimes}
\input{tables/dense_baseline}
Under matched parameter/compute settings, QSMoE is faster than dense on both
tested scales: 1.252x (small) and 1.193x (large), supporting the claim that
the sparse/compression-native path is practically useful, not only compact.

\subsection{Compression Fidelity and Determinism}
\input{tables/track_t_parity}
Track T shows tight parity against exported golden artifacts, with
max absolute error below \(8\times10^{-4}\), low NRMSE, manifold invariant
checks passing, and exact deterministic replay across 10 runs.

\subsection{External Harness Snapshot (Calibration Checkpoint)}
\input{tables/external_eval}
The external snapshot is intentionally small-scale (\texttt{mmlu-tiny}, fixed
seed) and is used as an early calibration/behavior checkpoint, not a final
generalization claim.
