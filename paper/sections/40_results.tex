\section{Results}
\subsection{Gate Status}
From \texttt{artifacts/reports/summary.md} (timestamp 2026-02-08T11:18:16Z):
Q=PASS, QS=PASS (5 seeds), P=PASS, PS=PASS (5 runs), DB=PASS, T=PASS, X=PASS.

\subsection{Performance (Canonical Multi-Run Statistics)}
\input{tables/perf_multirun}

Relative to serial in the same benchmark family, mean throughput improves by
5.00x for \texttt{Parallel} and 5.15x for \texttt{ParallelZeroCopy}.

\subsection{Dense Matched Baseline}
\input{tables/dense_baseline}

\subsection{External Harness Snapshot}
\input{tables/external_eval}

\subsection{Parity and Correctness}
\input{tables/track_t_parity}

Track T confirms numerical agreement against the tested golden artifacts,
including deterministic replay over 10 runs.
