\section{Conclusion}
This paper validates a specific sparse-modeling thesis: routing by
reconstruction error, paired with manifold-constrained shared-anchor
quantization, can produce an auditable and efficient MoE stack.
In the current MCQSMoE snapshot, the method is internally consistent
(deterministic and parity-verified), faster than matched dense baselines in the
tested settings, and measurably faster than serial execution under repeated runs.

The next publication step is clear: keep the same claim discipline while adding
large external benchmarks and serving-level evaluations. If those results hold,
the method transitions from a strong internal technical result to a broader
competitive claim.
