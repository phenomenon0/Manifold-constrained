\section{Conclusion}
We present an arXiv-ready rigor-parity package for MCQSMoE that ties claims to
executable tracks, strict gates, and frozen artifacts. In the current snapshot,
all protocol gates pass and benchmark throughput gains are statistically
summarized with confidence intervals. The release is intentionally scoped:
it proves what is measured in this stack and explicitly documents what remains
unproven. This makes the package suitable for transparent iteration toward a
full external-benchmark paper.
