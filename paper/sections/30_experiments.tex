\section{Experimental Setup}
\subsection{Environment}
Environment metadata comes from \texttt{artifacts/env/env\_snapshot.txt}:
Linux 6.17.12, Go 1.25.5, CPU AMD Ryzen 7 7700X (16 logical cores),
31,184 MiB RAM. GPU metadata is unavailable in this snapshot.

\subsection{Commands and Seeds}
The canonical runner is:
\begin{verbatim}
./foundation_models/paper_mcsqoe/scripts/40_run_all.sh
\end{verbatim}
Track QS seeds are fixed at: \texttt{11 23 47 101 211}.
Track PS uses \(n=5\) repeated benchmark runs with 95\% CI computed as
\(1.96\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\).
Track DB runs dense-vs-QSMoE matched baseline benchmarks.
Track X runs a fixed-seed external-style MCQA harness on \texttt{mmlu-tiny}.

\subsection{Evaluation Scope}
Measured outcomes in this paper are strictly:
internal correctness, deterministic behavior on defined tests, and benchmark
throughput/latency behavior for selected paths, plus a lightweight external-style
harness snapshot for baseline calibration/accuracy comparison.
No public leaderboard superiority claim is made.
