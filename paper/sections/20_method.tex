\section{Method and Claim Compiler}
MCQSMoE routing in this codebase uses reconstruction-error-driven top-k expert
selection, then softmin weighting over selected errors.
Given token \(x\) and selected experts \(\mathcal{K}\),
\[
w_e = \frac{\exp(-\mathrm{err}_e / T)}{\sum_{e' \in \mathcal{K}} \exp(-\mathrm{err}_{e'} / T)}
\]
with fixed temperature \(T=0.1\) in the current implementation.

The protocol operates as a claim compiler:
Claim \(\rightarrow\) Track \(\rightarrow\) Script \(\rightarrow\) Artifact \(\rightarrow\) Gate.

\paragraph{Gate semantics.}
A run is successful only when all of the following hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item Q: all 6 quality tests pass.
\item QS: all configured seeds pass with no skip-detected failure.
\item P: all target benchmarks are emitted.
\item PS: all target benchmarks have full multi-run coverage and summary stats.
\item T: required trained/exported artifacts exist and all parity tests pass with no skips.
\end{itemize}
