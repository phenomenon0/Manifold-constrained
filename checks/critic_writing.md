# Critic Pass B: Writing And Communication

## Critical

1. Keep one canonical numeric source (`artifacts/bench/perf_multirun_stats.csv`).
2. State rigor-parity claim boundary in abstract and intro.

## Major

1. Separate single-run benchmark lines from multi-run statistical results.
2. Explicitly document CI method assumptions and limits.
3. Elevate known gaps into a main limitations section.

## Moderate

1. Use paper-style tables/figures instead of dashboard framing.
2. Keep terminology consistent (`MCQSMoE` vs `QSMoE`).
3. Move low-level implementation details to appendix where possible.
